Title = Flatmates Bill

Description:-An App that get as input the amount of a bill for particular period and the days
             each flatmate stay in house for that period.And return how much each flatmate has
             to pay (Pay base on no. of days flatmate stay in the flat at that Bill Period )
             It also generates a PDF file stating the total Bill, the names of flatmate,the
             period, and how much each of flatmate has to pay

Initial Design:-
Objects:- Bill:
            amount
            period
          Flatmate:
            name
            days_in_house
            pays():
                logic:-
                first we assume we will share bill base on 50 percentage (0.5) each
                i.e:- bill = 120 than f1 pays 60 and f2 pays 60
                than we saw carefully than what we found if we pay bill 50% (0.5)
                than linear formula would be:-
                f1_co_efficient * 120 + f2_co_efficient * 120 = 120
                where:- f1_co_efficient & f2_co_efficient is 0.5
                so base on above formula we try to find what should be the co-efficient that
                we can share bill to pay base on no. of days stayed in house, so we got following
                formula for finding co-efficient for each flatmate
                f1_co_efficient = no. of days f1 stayed in flat / total no.of days both f1&f2 stayed in flat
                f2_co_efficient = no. of days f2 stayed in flat / total no.of days both f1&f2 stayed in flat
                amount_f1_pay = f1_co_efficient * amount
                amount_f2_pay = f2_co_efficient * amount

                we can check the amount share will be correct by putting it in following linear eq:-
                amount_f1_pay + amount_f2_pay = amount
